# Haskell

This is just enjoyable - programs just work (if they compile).

But the tooling is not as good as other languages (Rust ❤️, c++ 💔). 

To run, google into `ghcup` and then install the stuff right.

Build with `cabal build`, run all days with `cabal run`, or day N with `cabal run aoc-2025 -- N`
