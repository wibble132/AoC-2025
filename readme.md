# Advent of Code 2025

This is my solutions, in multiple languages, for fun.

Each day will probably be correct in some language, at least for my inputs.

I use Nix to manage my code - if you don't have nix then just ignore that stuff. There's some basic intro to running the code but I make no guarentees about the working-ness of any of this.

Have fun!


### Why each language

#### Rust

This is just the language that I find most enjoyable and easy to write in. It just works without being stupid.

#### C++

My work, and many other people, use c++. I should probably learn a bit of it. It feels like fighting a demon
whose only method of battle is large swathes of unintelligle prose.

I heard someone say that the most verbose solutions in C++ are often the most modern and "correct". I `const`
feel like I `const` agree with this `const statement&`.


#### Haskell

This is just fun to write. No one wants to write prod in Haskell though, since they are too scared.
