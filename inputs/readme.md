# Input Files

I've not included my inputs here, since they are the property of the awsome dude who makes Advent of Code.

To make this work, place your inputs in files in this folder, with the filenames `dayNN.txt` with a leading zero for days 1-9, e.g. `day01.txt`, `day02.txt`, ... `day11.txt`.

The programs all reference up to this directory for the inputs, assuming they are run in their directories.
